TO DO LIST:

Short Term:
- Finish cube turns, need to move references to individual pieces after each turn
- Finish turns, need to account for rotation of entire cube
- Integrate visualiser with backend cube representation

Long Term:
- Create solver
- Long term, proper move window gui improvements
