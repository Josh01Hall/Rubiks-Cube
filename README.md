TO DO LIST:

Short Term:
- Finish cube turns, need to move references to individual pieces after each turn
- Finish turns, need to account for rotation of entire cube

Long Term:
- Create solver, need to animate first as that will affect how cube is represented in backend
- Long term, proper move window gui improvements
