TO DO LIST:

Short Term:
- Fix cube rotation, need some kind of angle offset based on previous rotation
- Sort black lines becoming invisible in certain perspectives

Long Term:
- Animate cube turns, probably make 27 individual cubes and rotate 9 on one side 90 degrees, then let user rotate camera view
- Create solver, need to animate first as that will affect how cube is represented in backend
- Long term, proper move window gui improvements
